## [Unreleased]

## [3.4.0] - 2026-09-01

### 🥊 Added

- **Normalized reasoning (`delta.reasoning` / `message.reasoning`)**: reasoning-capable models could always be _enabled_ — `params` passes straight through to the provider body, so `params: { thinking: { type: "enabled", budget_tokens: 10000 } }` (Claude) or `params: { reasoning_effort: "high" }` (OpenAI) already reached the API. But the reasoning that came back was parsed out and **silently dropped**: Claude's stream reader only handled `text_delta`/`input_json_delta`/`tool_use`, and `BaseService` only extracted `delta.content`/`delta.tool_calls`. You paid for thinking tokens and never saw them. Reasoning now surfaces on the **same OpenAI envelope every provider already normalizes onto** — `choices[].delta.reasoning` when streaming, `choices[].message.reasoning` synchronously — so implementers read it identically regardless of which model is behind it, with no provider branching. Providers each spelling it differently on the wire (Anthropic `thinking_delta`, DeepSeek `reasoning_content`) are mapped onto that one key on **both** paths: streaming in `BaseService.sendStreamRequest()` (which OpenAI and every provider extending it already routes through) and synchronously in `BaseService.sendChatRequest()`. `MockService` replaces the transport wholesale, so it applies the identical normalization in its own overrides — otherwise tests written against the mock would be asserting a contract production doesn't have. **Every chat provider is covered**, by one of three routes: those delegating to `super.chat()`/`super.chatStream()` (Grok, Groq, Mistral, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Perplexity, MiniMax, HuggingFace, DockerModelRunner, OpenAICompatible) and those calling the inherited transport directly (Cohere, Gemini) inherit it from `BaseService`; those building their own chunks get explicit mapping (Claude `thinking_delta`, Ollama `message.thinking`, Claude-on-Bedrock `delta.thinking` plus OpenAI-shaped Bedrock models in either spelling). **Absence is normal, never an error** — a provider or model with no reasoning simply omits the key, and `message.reasoning ?: ""` degrades silently; deliberately _not_ modeled as a capability interface, since reasoning varies per _model_ (Sonnet vs. Haiku, gpt-5 vs. gpt-4o), which a per-provider interface can't express. Reasoning is kept strictly separate from `content` and is never folded into the assistant message persisted to memory — otherwise the model's private thinking would be replayed back to it as if it had said it. `MockService` can script reasoning (`{ content: "...", reasoning: "..." }`, emitted before content just like a real provider), so reasoning-aware consumers are testable offline with no reasoning-capable model.
- **`aiGatewaySession( agent, gateways, policy )`**: wires one `AiAgent` to one-or-more `IGateway` instances for inbound message handling — a message arrives, `GatewaySession` dispatches it as an agent turn (async, off the caller's thread), and relays output back through whichever gateway it arrived on (streamed chunk-by-chunk for gateways that declare `"streaming"`, buffered into one delivery otherwise). `gateways` accepts a single gateway or an array, and each entry can be a string name (resolved via `aiGateway( name )` — core names or anything in `aiGatewayRegistry()`) or an already-constructed `IGateway` instance — mix and match. A second message arriving on a thread that already has a turn in flight is handled per a configurable `policy`: `"reject"` (immediate refusal), `"queue"` (default — buffered, dispatched once the current turn finishes), `"steer"` (spliced into the _live_ turn via `steerRun()` — not a new turn), or `"interrupt"` (`cancelRun()` the current turn, then queue the new message next). `maxQueueDepth` bounds buffered messages per thread before falling back to reject. `session.isRunning()`/`getActiveThreadIds()`/`getQueueDepth( threadId )` for lifecycle/observability queries. Fires `onGatewaySessionCreate` when constructed.
- **`AiAgent.cancelRun( threadId )` / `steerRun( threadId, message )`**: cancel or steer an agent run already in flight, addressed purely by `threadId` — no token to construct or wire up, every agent supports this out of the box. Takes effect at the run's next `beforeLLMCall`/`beforeToolCall` checkpoint: cancelling stops the run with a terminal `AiMiddlewareResult.cancel()`; steering splices a new message into the live request without restarting anything already in progress. Both return `false` as a safe no-op when the thread has no run currently in flight. Fires `onAIAgentRunCancel`/`onAIAgentRunSteer` (with `agent`/`threadId`/`reason`/`input`) whenever one actually affects a run — not on the no-op case.
- **Batch tool-call approvals into one suspension, resume without replaying the LLM call**: when a turn requests multiple tool calls needing approval, they now suspend together as ONE checkpoint instead of one at a time (the rest used to be silently skipped). `agent.resume()`/`resumeStream()` accept a single decision or an array of per-call decisions, and finish the batch directly — no LLM replay, nothing already executed runs twice. Consistent across OpenAI, Claude, Bedrock, and Cohere; streaming batching covers OpenAI and Claude (the only two with streaming tool-call support today).
- **Bedrock provider parity**: bearer-token auth (explicit `bearerToken` or `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`, opt-in only and never inferred from `apiKey`), the AWS default credential chain (explicit → env → ECS/EKS container → EC2 IMDSv2, with expiry-aware caching and a negative cache), Guardrails plus `x-amzn-bedrock-*` header passthrough, a `baseURL` endpoint override honoured by both the request URL and the SigV4 `Host` header, and Cohere / Titan-v2 embedding request shapes. ([#227](https://github.com/ortus-boxlang/bx-ai/issues/227))
- New Gateway SPI (`IGateway`, `AgentSuspension`, `GatewayRegistry`, `aiGateway()`) with a `MockGateway` reference implementation — foundation for HTTP/CLI and future platform gateway modules.
- HITL extracted into a `models/hitl/` package: pluggable `IApprovalPolicy` implementations, a `HumanInteractionCoordinator` owning the suspend/resolve lifecycle, and gateway-attached `HumanInTheLoopMiddleware`.
- CLI gateway extracted as the reference `IGateway` implementation; `HumanInTheLoopMiddleware` now always presents through an attached gateway (zero behavior change for existing usage).
- `aiGateway()` now resolves external gateways via `aiGatewayRegistry()` instead of an interception point.
- Generic HTTP/webhook gateway (`HttpGateway`) with HMAC request signing, nonce dedup, TTL-bounded interactions, and atomic decision claims.
- Durable/session approval grants (`approve_always`/`approve_session`) via a pluggable `IDecisionStore` — cache, JDBC, and file-backed implementations, resolved through `aiDecisionStore()`.
- `CliGateway`'s approval prompt now offers `approve_always`/`approve_session`, not just approve/reject/quit.
- `HumanInTheLoopMiddleware` now defaults its `IDecisionStore` from `settings.hitl.decisionStore` instead of never having one.
- **`aiGateway( ..., register, module )`**: opt into auto-registering the constructed gateway into `aiGatewayRegistry()` — `aiGateway( "http", register: true )`, matching `aiAgent()`'s/`aiTool()`'s own auto-register pattern. Defaults to `false`. Renamed the registry accessor BIF from `gatewayRegistry()` to `aiGatewayRegistry()` to match the `aiAgentRegistry()`/`aiToolRegistry()` naming convention (breaking rename — no alias kept).
- **`IGateway.isRunning()` / `onError()`**: two new additive lifecycle hooks, alongside `onMessage()`. `isRunning()` reports whether `start()` has been called and `stop()` hasn't since. `onError()` registers a callback invoked when a gateway's connection drops unexpectedly, so a caller doesn't have to poll `isRunning()` to notice. Both default to safe no-ops; `MockGateway` is now a full reference implementation of both (plus a `simulateError()` test helper), and none of the existing core gateways need to change.
- **Gateway observability events**: `onGatewayConnect`/`onGatewayDisconnect` fire on a real `start()`/`stop()` state transition (never on a redundant call while already in that state) — `BaseGateway.start()`/`stop()` are now template methods handling this and `isRunning()` automatically for every gateway, so a concrete gateway overrides `onStart()`/`onStop()` for its own connect/disconnect logic instead of `start()`/`stop()` directly, and gets the tracking/events for free. `onGatewayMessageReceived`/`onGatewayMessageSent` fire from `parseInbound()`/`deliver()` (implemented in `MockGateway` and `HttpGateway`, the two gateways with real inbound/outbound logic today) with payload including `threadId`/`userId`/`conversationId` — so "who sent this, on which thread" is always available to an observability consumer, independent of whether `GatewaySession` is in the picture.
- `OutputGuardMiddleware` — redacts secrets/PII (email, SSN, credit card w/ Luhn check, API keys, JWTs, etc.) and strips data-exfiltration markdown from model responses. Fully offline.
- `LLMGuardMiddleware` — LLM-as-judge classification of requests/responses for prompt-injection or harmful content, using a second (cheaper/local) model.
- Untrusted-content fencing (`aiFence()`, `AiMessage.addUntrusted()`) — RAG/tool/web content is wrapped in tamper-resistant boundary markers; `${context}` is auto-fenced by default.
- Security & Guardrails Phase 1: `PromptSecurity` heuristic injection scanning, `InputSanitizerMiddleware`, global `settings.security` auto-attach, and a new `mock` AI provider for deterministic offline testing.
- `beforeLLMCall`/`afterLLMCall` now fire on the streaming path for every provider, not just OpenAI-family.
- `SummaryMemory` supports a token-based trigger (`maxTokens`) as an alternative to `maxMessages`.
- `summarize()` is now available on every conversation memory type, not just `SummaryMemory`.
- New interception points: `onAIMemorySummarize`, `onAiDecisionStoreCreate`, `onGatewayCreate`, `onGatewaySessionCreate`, `onGatewayRegistryRegister`, `onGatewayRegistryUnregister`, `onGatewayConnect`, `onGatewayDisconnect`, `onGatewayMessageReceived`, `onGatewayMessageSent`, `onAIAgentRunCancel`, `onAIAgentRunSteer`.

### 🧠 Updated

- Default AI request timeout (`settings.timeout`) bumped from 45 to 90 seconds. A timed-out HTTP call surfaces as a confusing `JsonDeserializationError` ("Failed to parse JSON... Request Timeout") rather than a clear timeout error, and 45s was too tight for slower providers/models under load; raising the default reduces intermittent failures for CLI/`.bxs` usage. Still overridable per-request via `options.timeout` or per-provider via `settings.providers.<name>.options.timeout`.
- **Groq's default chat model** bumped from the now-deprecated `llama-3.1-8b-instant` (removed by Groq on 2026-08-16) to its recommended replacement, `openai/gpt-oss-20b`.
- OpenAI provider's default chat model bumped from `gpt-5-nano` to `gpt-5.6-luna`.
- Claude provider's default chat model bumped from `claude-sonnet-4-5` to `claude-sonnet-5`.
- `SummaryMemory`: `maxMessages` now triggers compression and `summaryThreshold` is the keep-window (previously threshold did both and `maxMessages` was unused).
- `AiMessage` escapes `${...}` inside binding values by default to prevent template-confusion injection.
- Inbound user content is now NFKC-normalized and stripped of zero-width characters by default, even without `settings.security` enabled.

### 🪲 Fixed

- **`IAiMemory.summarize()` ignored `userId`/`conversationId` scoping**, unlike every other memory method (`add`, `getAll`, `trim`, etc.). On a shared/stateless memory instance serving multiple users or conversations, calling `summarize()` always compressed whichever scope happened to resolve to the instance default — effectively collapsing all users'/conversations' history together instead of the one actually intended. `summarize( config, userId, conversationId )` now accepts the same optional `userId`/`conversationId` overrides as the rest of the interface, correctly scoping the read, the AI compression, and the persisted result (cache/file/database/session) to just that user, that conversation, or — with neither passed — the instance default, same as before. `SummaryMemory`'s auto-trigger (`trim()`) now forwards its own `userId`/`conversationId` into `summarize()` instead of dropping them. Also fixes a related gap where `SessionMemory` had no `summarize()` override at all, so any triggered summary silently never made it back into session storage. Each `summarize()` call is now serialized per `(key, userId, conversationId)` scope via a named lock, so concurrent calls for different scopes on one shared instance no longer risk clobbering each other's in-flight compression.
- **Enabling Claude extended thinking broke `aiChat()` outright.** The synchronous path read the answer as `result.content.first().text`, but with `params: { thinking: {...} }` Anthropic returns one or more `thinking` blocks _before_ the text block — so that read was null and every sync return format (`single`, `json`, `xml`, `structuredOutput`) silently produced an empty answer. Now selects the first **text** block. Bedrock had a matching hole on the streaming side: its `transformStreamChunk()` dropped any chunk with no content or finish reason, which is exactly what every chunk looks like while a model is still reasoning.
- `approve_always`/`approve_session` grants never actually persisted for async (non-CLI) gateways — missing identity on `GatewayContext` and an incomplete resume-path decision handler. Fixed; new integration test covers suspend → resume with a grant → auto-approve on a later run.
- HITL suspend/cancel/reject were silently swallowed by a closure-scoping bug in OpenAI's tool-call loop — batches now stop/skip correctly and checkpoint as expected.
- `RunControlMiddleware.afterAgentRun()` released a run's cancellation token by an unconditional registry remove rather than a compare-and-swap — two `run()`/`stream()` calls sharing a `threadId` while both were in flight (now a real scenario under `GatewaySession`'s `queue`/`interrupt` policies) could have the first call to finish evict the _other_ call's still-active token, silently breaking `cancelRun`/`steerRun` for the run still going.
- `beforeToolCall`/`afterToolCall`/`wrapToolCall` never fired for Claude, Bedrock, or Cohere (tools were invoked directly) — all three now go through the same middleware pipeline as OpenAI.
- Claude/Bedrock/Cohere tool-call context lacked normalized `toolName`/`toolArgs`, so argument-based guardrails and HITL's edit-resume path silently no-op'd for those providers.
- `MockService` streamed a non-standard chunk shape, and `AiAgent.stream()`'s middleware-stop sentinel check used unsafe dot-access; both now match production streaming behavior.
- `returnFormat: "json"`/`asJson()` returned `{}` when the reply had a ```` ```json ```` marker inside a string value or in prose, or braces before the real payload. Fence extraction is now parse-validated and the brace/bracket scan retries at each candidate; an unusable reply logs a warning instead of failing silently. ([#222](https://github.com/ortus-boxlang/bx-ai/issues/222))
- Complex struct `returnFormat` generated getter/setter names instead of property names — BoxLang class instances satisfy `isStruct()`, so `SchemaBuilder` now checks `isObject()` first throughout, including for arrays of class/struct instances. ([#182](https://github.com/ortus-boxlang/bx-ai/issues/182))
- MCP tools crashed the Claude and Bedrock providers — `BaseTool` now provides a default `getArgumentsSchema()`. ([#231](https://github.com/ortus-boxlang/bx-ai/issues/231))
- Renamed several bare `request`/`server`/`url` locals that could shadow BoxLang's reserved scopes (hygiene fix; no confirmed live bug found in this codebase).

#### AWS Bedrock

- **AWS profile-file credentials never worked**: `AwsCredentialProvider.parseCredentialsFile()` called `chr()`, which is not a BoxLang function, so every attempt to read `~/.aws/credentials` threw `Function [chr] not found` and step 3 of the documented credential chain was dead. The function had no test coverage, which is how it survived. Now uses `char()`, with tests. ([#259](https://github.com/ortus-boxlang/bx-ai/issues/259))
- **EKS Pod Identity could not authenticate through `AwsCredentialProvider`**, so `OpenSearchVectorMemory` — its only consumer — failed against any OpenSearch domain using pod-level IAM. The container credential request sent **no `Authorization` header at all**, which both EKS Pod Identity and ECS-with-`AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_FULL_URI` require. The token is now resolved per the AWS container credential provider spec — `AWS_CONTAINER_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN_FILE` first (re-read on every call, since Pod Identity rotates it) then the inline `AWS_CONTAINER_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN` — and sent with the request. ([#259](https://github.com/ortus-boxlang/bx-ai/issues/259), [#227](https://github.com/ortus-boxlang/bx-ai/issues/227))
- **`AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_FULL_URI` was fetched verbatim while carrying a bearer token.** Plain HTTP is now restricted to loopback and the documented ECS (`169.254.170.2`) / EKS Pod Identity (`169.254.170.23`) link-local addresses; any other host must use HTTPS, and an untrusted endpoint is refused with a warning rather than being handed the token — matching the AWS SDKs' own restriction. ([#259](https://github.com/ortus-boxlang/bx-ai/issues/259))
- **Bedrock's auto-resolved credential cache never actually cached anything.** `aiService()` builds a fresh provider on every call, but `resolvedCredentials`, the negative-cache timestamp and the lock name (a `createUUID()`) were all per-instance — so the cache was written once and never read, every request re-hit the ECS/EKS container or EC2 IMDS endpoint, and the 60-second negative cache could never fire, meaning a host with no metadata service paid the full container+IMDS timeout on _every_ call rather than once a minute. Auto-resolved credentials now live in a cache shared across instances, keyed by region plus credential source, with the named lock derived from that key so concurrent refreshes for one source collapse into a single metadata round-trip while different sources don't serialize against each other. Explicit and environment credentials still bypass the whole mechanism. ([#258](https://github.com/ortus-boxlang/bx-ai/issues/258))
- **Explicit AWS credentials could be signed with an unrelated session token.** `init()` seeds the instance from the environment, so a later `configure({ awsAccessKeyId, awsSecretAccessKey })` carrying no token of its own replaced only the key pair and kept `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` — a token belonging to different credentials. SigV4 signed the mismatched triple and AWS rejected the request. Credentials now resolve as an atomic set: an explicit access key defines the whole set, so the secret and session token come from that same source or not at all. ([#227](https://github.com/ortus-boxlang/bx-ai/issues/227))
- Bedrock model-family detection was inconsistent across request/response/stream transforms (AI21, Cohere, legacy Mistral, and bare inference-profile ARNs could get mismatched parsing). ([#226](https://github.com/ortus-boxlang/bx-ai/issues/226))
- Bedrock's Claude request transform could throw on tool objects holding non-serializable data; now shallow-copies params instead of deep-duplicating. ([#221](https://github.com/ortus-boxlang/bx-ai/issues/221))
- Bedrock provider parity: chat events were announced under legacy `onAIRequest`/`onAIResponse` names nothing listened for, 429s weren't recognized as rate limits (no `onAIRateLimitHit`), `configure()`'s struct path skipped the settings merge, multi-block Claude responses dropped all but the first `text` block, header-only token usage reported zero, streaming logging ignored `logRequest`/`logResponse`, inference-profile ARNs routed to a non-existent path, array-shaped content corrupted Titan/Llama/Mistral requests, `onAIError` was announced twice, `checkGuardrailIntervention()` iterated an unguarded struct, and a `baseURL` path prefix was silently dropped. ([#227](https://github.com/ortus-boxlang/bx-ai/issues/227))
- Tools and schema-typed `returnFormat` were silently dropped on non-Claude Bedrock model families; they now throw `UnsupportedProviderCapability` naming the detected family. ([#227](https://github.com/ortus-boxlang/bx-ai/issues/227))
- Merged module-settings params never reached Bedrock's **embeddings** payload either: `chat()`/`chatStream()` merge the configured service params, but `embeddings()` did not, so a module-configured `input_type`, `dimensions` or `normalize` was silently dropped from the InvokeModel body. ([#227](https://github.com/ortus-boxlang/bx-ai/issues/227))
- Merged module-settings params never reached Bedrock's request body: `configure()` merges `settings.defaultParams` and `settings.providers.Bedrock.params` into `variables.params`, but `variables.params` was only ever read for `.model`, so a module-configured `temperature`/`top_p`/`max_tokens` was silently dropped. `chat()`/`chatStream()` now call `mergeServiceParams( variables.params )` like every other provider (request-level params still win). ([#227](https://github.com/ortus-boxlang/bx-ai/issues/227))
- **`OutputGuardMiddleware` silently did nothing on Bedrock's non-Claude families**, `action: "block"` included. `afterLLMCall` hands middleware the raw provider body (as Claude, Cohere and Gemini all do), but `PromptSecurity::getResponseText`/`setResponseText` only knew the OpenAI, Claude, Gemini and Cohere-chat shapes — so Bedrock's Titan (`results[].outputText`), Llama (`generation`), Mistral (`outputs[].text`) and legacy-Cohere (`generations[].text`) bodies resolved to an empty string and every guard no-op'd. The resolver now understands those four shapes and writes back in place, so a redaction also scrubs the content reused as the assistant turn on the tool-call path. It also now reads and rewrites **every** Claude `content[]` text block rather than only the first: `transformResponseFromClaude()` joins all of them into the returned response, so a safe opening block followed by one carrying a secret was previously returned without the guard ever seeing it, and a redaction rewrote block one while leaving the secret in block two to be joined back in. Redaction collapses the text blocks into one, leaving interleaved `tool_use` blocks untouched.
- **Claude's reasoning also bypassed the guard**: `ClaudeService` attached the derived `result.reasoning` _after_ `afterLLMCall` had already run, and its streaming middleware context omitted the accumulated reasoning entirely — so both paths returned reasoning that no guard had scanned. The attach now happens before the hook fires, and the streaming context carries `reasoning`. Note that **streaming guards are detection-only, not prevention**, for reasoning and content alike and on every provider: `afterLLMCall` fires once the stream has ended, so `block` throws after the caller's callback already received the chunks and `redact` rewrites an aggregate the provider has finished emitting. Documented on `OutputGuardMiddleware`; withholding mid-stream needs a per-chunk hook, tracked separately.
- **Bedrock's `onAIChatResponse` listeners were the only consumers that never saw reasoning.** `BaseService.sendChatRequest()` normalizes reasoning ahead of its own announce so listeners and the caller share one shape, but Bedrock announced the untouched native body. The derived `reasoning` key is now attached before the announce.
- **`OutputGuardMiddleware` never inspected the model's reasoning**, so a secret Claude named while thinking and never repeated in its answer was returned to the caller unscrubbed — and because the guard bailed out on empty content, a thinking-only turn was not scanned at all. `action: "block"` never fired for it either. Reasoning is now resolved and scrubbed independently of the answer via `PromptSecurity::getResponseReasoning`/`setResponseReasoning`, covering the provider-attached derived key, the OpenAI envelope in either native spelling (`reasoning`/`reasoning_content`), and accumulated streaming reasoning. **The native `thinking` blocks are deliberately never touched**: Bedrock requires the thinking blocks of the latest assistant message to be passed back complete and unmodified within a tool-use turn, and rejects a modified block outright (`thinking or redacted_thinking blocks in the latest assistant message cannot be modified`), so the scrub lands on a derived copy that never reaches the wire while the blocks go back byte-identical. Bedrock's streaming path now also accumulates reasoning so a guard can inspect it there, and reasoning is kept strictly out of `content` throughout. ([AWS extended-thinking docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/claude-messages-extended-thinking.html))
- Cohere-on-Bedrock generation failures were normalized as successful empty completions: `finish_reason: "error"` (which AWS documents as "the generation could not be completed due to an error", returned with `text: ""`) produced a normal-looking response with `finish_reason: "stop"`, so callers had no way to retry or report it. It now raises `ProviderError`. `error_limit` maps to `length` (a context-limit outcome), `error_toxic` to `content_filter`, and `user_cancel` to `stop`.
- Cohere-on-Bedrock responses were normalized by the Claude transform, which looks for a `content[]` array. Command R returns `{ text }` and legacy Command returns `{ generations: [ { text } ] }`, so every reply became an empty string, and the header-backfilled token counts were reported as zero. Added `transformResponseFromCohere()` covering both shapes, reading `response.usage` back like the Mistral transform, mapping Cohere's `COMPLETE`/`MAX_TOKENS`/`ERROR_TOXIC` onto OpenAI finish reasons, and logging rather than silently returning empty when a body matches neither shape. **Note:** this is the response half only — `transformRequestForModel()` still deliberately sends Cohere a Claude-shaped request, so Cohere-on-Bedrock is not yet functional end to end; a dedicated request transform is tracked separately.
- **Four Bedrock response-header reads were not normalized for array-shaped multi-value headers**, unlike every other header read in the provider. `checkGuardrailIntervention()` read `x-amzn-bedrock-guardrailaction` raw, so an array-shaped header turned the `findNoCase()` below it into an `arrayFindNoCase()` against header values and silently missed the intervention it exists to report. `retryAfter` in the `onAIRateLimitHit` payload had the same gap in all three 429 handlers (chat, stream, embeddings), so a rate-limit-aware retry middleware doing `val( retryAfter )` would get `0` instead of the real backoff. All four now go through `firstHeaderValue()`. ([#227](https://github.com/ortus-boxlang/bx-ai/issues/227))
- **Bedrock reported reasoning only when streaming.** Upstream normalized reasoning onto `choices[].message.reasoning` (sync) / `choices[].delta.reasoning` (stream) and patched Bedrock's _stream_ path, but Bedrock overrides `chat()` wholesale, so it never passes through `BaseService.sendChatRequest()` where `normalizeReasoningMessage()` runs — and its Claude response transform filtered content to `type == "text"`, dropping `thinking` blocks entirely. Claude-on-Bedrock extended thinking is now surfaced as `message.reasoning` (joined across multiple thinking blocks, never folded into `content`), and OpenAI-shaped Bedrock models answering with a native `reasoning_content` — DeepSeek-on-Bedrock — are normalized too, since `transformResponseFromOpenAI()` returns already-OpenAI-shaped bodies verbatim. The key is **omitted** when the model didn't think, matching the contract's "absence is normal". ([#227](https://github.com/ortus-boxlang/bx-ai/issues/227))
- **`beforeLLMCall` middleware could not mutate the request body on Bedrock's streaming path**: `sendBedrockStreamRequest()` serialized `dataPacket` to JSON _before_ firing the hook, so anything the hook changed was signed and sent as the pre-hook body. The sync path already ordered these correctly. Serialization now happens after the hook, as it does in every other provider. ([#227](https://github.com/ortus-boxlang/bx-ai/issues/227))

### 🔐 Security Fixes

- Gemini's API key was leaking into logs via the request URL (`?key=...`). Key is now request-local, and `PromptSecurity::redactURLSecrets()` masks key/token/secret query params in any logged endpoint as defense in depth.

## [3.3.2] - 2026-06-19

### 🪲 Fixed

- **Claude structured output via synthetic tool**: Claude models lack OpenAI-style `response_format`, so structured output was silently unsupported — the schema was never sent and `populateStructuredOutput()` failed parsing the model's prose. Fixed by injecting a synthetic `structured_output` tool (requested schema as `input_schema`), pinning `tool_choice` to it, and routing the returned `tool_use.input` through `populateStructuredOutput()`. Now fails loud with `StructuredOutputError` + ai-log when the forced tool block is absent (max_tokens truncation / refusal / tool_choice not honored) instead of feeding prose into the JSON populator. Adds deterministic, credential-free tests (beforeLLMCall packet capture + wrapLLMCall canned-response extraction/throw) for both providers, plus a live Bedrock structured-output test. [#198](https://github.com/ortus-boxlang/bx-ai/issues/198)

## [3.3.1] - 2026-06-03

### 🪲 Fixed

- **`@AITool` scan generates wrong parameter schema**: `aiToolRegistry().scanClass()` was wrapping annotated methods in a generic `(args) =>` lambda. `getArgumentsSchema()` introspected that wrapper and produced a single `args` property instead of the actual method parameters (e.g., `orderId`), and the `required` array was always empty for scanned tools. Fixed by storing the original method's parameter metadata (`name`, `type`, `required`) on the `ClosureTool` via `setMethodParameters()` and using it during schema generation when present. The wrapper lambda was also corrected to forward named arguments via the `arguments` scope, ensuring invocation works correctly once the schema exposes real parameter names.

## [3.3.0] - 2026-05-30

### 🥊 Added

- **BedrockService Tool-Use Support for Claude Models (#190)**: AWS Bedrock's Claude models now support native tool/function calling, matching the feature set of the direct Anthropic API.
  - `formatToolsForClaude()` converts OpenAI-compatible tool schemas to the Claude-native `input_schema` format.
  - `executeBedrockTool()` processes Claude `tool_use` blocks, invokes the registered tool, and appends `tool_result` messages back into the conversation.
  - Multi-turn tool conversations are preserved by correctly handling structured content (arrays of `tool_use`/`tool_result` blocks) without flattening them via `toString()`.
  - New integration tests in `BedrockTest.java` covering tool-enabled chat and multi-turn tool interactions.

### 🪲 Fixed

- **MCPRequestProcessor CORS parameter collision**: Renamed the `mcpServer` parameter in `handleCORSPreflight()` to `targetServer` to avoid a case-insensitive name collision with the `MCPServer` import, which caused the stricter BoxLang compiler to reject the file and 500 every MCP request.

### 🧠 Updated

- Removed obsolete scheduler test stubs (`DataProcessingScheduler.bx`, `ReportingScheduler.bx`).
- Added Spreadsheet Loader integration documentation to the README.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-05-14

### 🥊 New Features

- **Web Search Tools & BIF**: New `aiWebSearch()` BIF and `WebSearchTools` class providing multi-provider web search for AI agents.
  - **`aiWebSearch(query, params, options)`** BIF — simple entry point for web search (renamed from `webSearch()`).
  - **`webSearch@bxai` tool** — auto-registered AI tool enabling agents to search the web during conversations.
  - **`aiWebSearchAsync(query, options)`** BIF — non-blocking variant returning a `BoxFuture` resolved on the `io-tasks` executor (renamed from `webSearchAsync()`); all providers also expose `searchAsync()` directly.
  - **`searchAsync(query, options)`** — all search providers now expose a non-blocking async variant that returns a `BoxFuture` resolved on the `io-tasks` executor.
  - **5 web search interception points** — full observability into the search pipeline via `BoxRegisterInterceptor()`:
    - `beforeAIWebSearch` — fired before any search executes (provider, query, options)
    - `afterAIWebSearch` — fired after search completes (results + `cached: boolean` flag for future caching support)
    - `onAIWebSearchRequest` — fired immediately before the HTTP/API request is sent (url, method, headers)
    - `onAIWebSearchResponse` — fired after a successful HTTP/API response is received (statusCode, response)
    - `onAIWebSearchError` — fired on any search failure before the exception propagates (error)
  - **6 search providers** via interface-driven design (`IWebSearch`):
    - **Brave** — official API, free tier 2K queries/mo, set `BRAVE_API_KEY` env var
    - **Google Custom Search** — best result quality, requires `GOOGLE_API_KEY` + `GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID`
    - **Tavily** — AI-optimized search, free tier 1K queries/mo, set `TAVILY_API_KEY` env var
    - **Exa** — neural/semantic search engine built for AI, set `EXA_API_KEY` env var; supports `type: keyword|neural|magic`, `country`, and `language` filters
    - **HTTP** — (Default) generic URL fetcher for direct page retrieval
  - **Consistent result format** — all providers return `[{title, url, snippet, publishedDate, domain, score, thumbnail, language}]` regardless of underlying API.
  - **Three-tier API key resolution** — constructor config → module settings → environment variables.
  - **ModuleConfig settings** — `webSearch` section for global configuration (default provider, max results, timeout, API keys including `exaApiKey`, logging).
  - **All HTTP calls centralized** in `BaseSearch` for consistent logging, error handling, and proxy support.

- **MCP Server IP Allowlist & Proxy-Aware Client IP Extraction**: `MCPServer` now supports IP-based access control with automatic client IP resolution from common proxy headers.
  - **`withAllowedIPs(ips)`**: Configure allowed IP addresses or CIDR ranges. Pass empty array to allow all (default).
  - **`addAllowedIP(ip)` / `clearAllowedIPs()`**: Incremental allowlist management.
  - **`hasAllowedIPs()`**: Check if IP filtering is active.
  - **`verifyClientIP(clientIP, requestData)`**: Validate a client IP against the allowlist with exact match and CIDR range support.
  - **`getClientIP(requestData)`**: Extract client IP from trusted proxy headers (`X-Forwarded-For`, `CF-Connecting-IP`, `True-Client-IP`, `X-Real-IP`) with fallback to `cgi.REMOTE_ADDR` for direct connections.
  - **CIDR range matching**: Support both individual IPs (`192.168.1.100`) and CIDR blocks (`192.168.0.0/24`) for IPv4 and IPv6.
  - **IP filter failure tracking**: Rejected IP checks recorded in `MCPServerStats.security.ipFilterFailures` counter and exposed in `getStats()` / `getSummary()`.
  - **Security rejection**: Denied IPs return HTTP 403 Forbidden with `INVALID_REQUEST` JSON-RPC error code.

- **Fluent Builder API for Audio BIFs**: `aiSpeak()`, `aiTranscribe()`, and `aiTranslate()` now
  support a fluent builder API. Calling any of these BIFs with no arguments returns the request
  object for chaining.
  - **`AiSpeechRequest`** gains:
    - `of(text)` static factory
    - `.text()`
    - `.model()`
    - `.provider()`
    - `.apiKey()`
    - `.voice()`
    - `.speed()`
    - `.instructions()`
    - `.outputFile()`
    - `.outputFormat()`
    - `.timeout()`
    - gender shortcuts (`.male()`, `.female()`)
    - format shortcuts (`.asMP3()`, `.asWav()`, `.asFlac()`, `.asOpus()`, `.asPCM()`)
    - `.withParams()`
    - `.withOptions()`
    - `.withLogging()`
    - `.speak()` terminator
  - **`AiTranscriptionRequest`** gains:
    - `of(audio)` static factory
    - `.file(path)`
    - `.url(url)`
    - `.data(binary)`
    - `.model()`
    - `.provider()`
    - `.apiKey()`
    - `.language()`
    - `.inputFormat()`
    - `.timeout()`
    - timestamp shortcuts (`.withWordTimestamps()`, `.withSegmentTimestamps()`, `.withTimestamps()`)
    - `.diarize()`
    - format shortcuts (`.asJSON()`, `.asText()`, `.asVerboseJSON()`, `.asSRT()`, `.asVTT()`)
    - `.withParams()`
    - `.withOptions()`
    - `.withLogging()`
    - dual terminators `.transcribe()` and `.translate()`

- **Image Generation — `aiImage()`**: New BIF for generating images from text prompts using any provider that implements `IAiImageService`.
  - **`aiImage( prompt, params, options )`** BIF: Generate one or more images from a text description. Returns an `AiImageResponse` (with `hasImages()`, `getCount()`, `getFirstURL()`, `getFirstBase64()`, `getRevisedPrompt()`, `saveToFile()`, `saveAllToDirectory()`, `toDataURI()`, `getMimeType()`, `toStruct()`) or saves directly to a file via `options.outputFile`.
  - **`IAiImageService`** interface: New capability interface implemented by providers that support text-to-image generation (`generateImage()`).
  - **`AiImageRequest`** object: Carries prompt, n, size, quality, style, instructions, outputFormat, and outputFile. All fields fluent via BoxLang property conventions.
  - **`AiImageResponse`** object: Wraps one or more generated images, each as a struct with `url`, `data` (binary), `mimeType`, and `revisedPrompt`. Convenience methods for saving, encoding, and embedding as data URIs.
  - **Provider support**:
    - **OpenAI** — `gpt-image-1` (default) and DALL-E models via `/v1/images/generations`. Supports quality/style/size controls and format/compression parameters.
    - **Gemini** — Imagen 3 (`imagen-3.0-generate-008`) via the Gemini API predict endpoint. Returns binary image data directly; `size` maps to aspect ratio (1:1, 16:9, 9:16).
    - **Grok (xAI)** — `grok-2-image` via `https://api.x.ai/v1/images/generations` (OpenAI-compatible format).
    - **OpenRouter** — FLUX Schnell (default) and many other image models via `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/images/generations` (OpenAI-compatible format).
  - **4 new interception points**: `beforeAIImageGeneration`, `afterAIImageGeneration`, `onAIImageRequest`, `onAIImageResponse`.
  - **`image` settings block** in module config: `defaultProvider`, `defaultApiKey`, `defaultModel`, `defaultSize`, `defaultQuality`, `defaultStyle`, `defaultInstructions`.
  - **`generateImage@bxai` agent tool**: New `ImageTools` class (`models/tools/image/ImageTools.bx`) auto-registered in the global tool registry at module startup. Generates an image from a text prompt, saves to a file (auto-generates a temp file when no `outputFile` is supplied), and returns the absolute path. Opt-in: `aiAgent( tools: [ "generateImage@bxai" ] )`.

- **MCP Server Observability & Analytics Improvements**
  - Multiple gaps in the MCP server's observability and analytics have been addressed.
  - **Thread-safety fix**: `byMethod`, `byTool`, `byUri`, `byName`, and `byCode` counters in `MCPServerStats` were plain struct mutations happening outside any lock, causing silent lost updates under concurrent load. All are now wrapped in dedicated named locks.
  - **Security failure tracking**: Basic auth rejections, API key rejections, and body-size violations now increment dedicated `AtomicInteger` counters (`security.authFailures`, `security.apiKeyFailures`, `security.bodySizeViolations`) visible in `getStats()` and `getSummary()`. `MCPServer` exposes a `recordSecurityFailure(type)` method for processor delegation.
  - **Paused-request stats**: Requests rejected due to `SERVER_PAUSED` are now recorded in stats (previously they were silently dropped from all counters).
  - **`onMCPError` for METHOD_NOT_FOUND**: The `default:` switch case was the only error path that never fired the `onMCPError` interception point. Fixed.
  - **Per-tool error tracking**: `handleToolCall()` now records a tool error via `recordToolError()` before rethrowing any exception. `MCPServerStats` gains `byTool[name].errors` and an `errors.byTool` roll-up counter.
  - **Active concurrent request counter**: `MCPServerStats` gains an `activeRequests` `AtomicInteger`; `handleRequest()` increments it on entry and decrements it in a `finally` block. Exposed in `getStats()` and `getSummary()`.
  - **Requests-per-minute rate**: `getSummary()` now includes `requestsPerMinute` calculated from uptime and total request count.
  - **X-Request-ID correlation**: `HTTPTransport` reads the `X-Request-ID` request header (or generates a UUID if absent); `StdioTransport` always generates one. The ID is echoed as `X-Request-ID` in the response headers and included in `onMCPRequest` and `onMCPResponse` event payloads.

- **Agent Registry**
  — New `AIAgentRegistry` singleton (access via `aiAgentRegistry()` BIF) modeled after `AIToolRegistry`. Allows users to explicitly register `AiAgent` instances for centralized discoverability, observability, and analytics.
  - `aiAgentRegistry().register( agent, module )` — register an `AiAgent` instance with optional module namespace. Key convention: `agentName` or `agentName@moduleName`.
  - `aiAgentRegistry().unregister( key )` / `unregisterByModule( module )` — remove agents from the registry.
  - `aiAgentRegistry().resolveAgents( array )` — lazily resolve a mixed array of string keys and `AiAgent` instances into `AiAgent[]`.
  - `aiAgentRegistry().listAgents()` — returns a struct of all registered agents mapped to `{ name, description, module }` for analytics dashboards and introspection.
  - `aiAgentRegistry().getAgentInfo( key )` — returns `{ name, description, module }` for a single registry key.
  - Two new interception points: `onAIAgentRegistryRegister`, `onAIAgentRegistryUnregister` — fired on every register/unregister operation for external observability hooks.
  - `aiAgent()` BIF gains two new parameters: `register: false` (opt-in flag) and `module: ""` — when `register: true` the agent is automatically placed in the registry at creation time. Defaults to `false` to prevent memory leaks from sub-agents and throwaway agents.

- **MCP Client Stats & Observability**
  - `MCPClient` now tracks internal usage and performance metrics via a new `MCPClientStats` instance (using atomic variables for thread safety).
  - `getStats()` — returns a fully serializable struct with call totals, per-operation-type breakdowns, response time avg/min/max, per-tool invocation stats (`count`, `totalTime`, `avgTime`), per-URI resource counts, per-name prompt counts, and error tracking.
  - `getSummary()` — lightweight summary with `totalCalls`, `successRate`, `avgResponseTime`, per-type totals, `totalErrors`, and `lastCallAt`.
  - `resetStats()` — resets all counters to zero (fluent).
  - Three new interception points fired from every HTTP call:
    - `onMCPClientRequest` — fires before the HTTP request with `{ client, baseURL, operation, name, requestBody }`.
    - `onMCPClientResponse` — fires on success with `{ client, baseURL, operation, name, response, executionTime, statusCode }`.
    - `onMCPClientError` — fires on HTTP errors (bad status / JSON-RPC error) and on network-level exceptions with `{ client, baseURL, operation, name, error, statusCode, executionTime }` (includes `exception` key when fired from a `catch` block).
  - Every operation type is tracked: `tool` (covers `listTools` + `send`), `resource` (covers `listResources` + `readResource`), `prompt` (covers `listPrompts` + `getPrompt`), `discovery` (`getCapabilities`).

- **MCP Server Pause/Resume**
  - `MCPServer` now supports pausing and resuming via `pause()` and `resume()` fluent methods. While paused, the server remains registered in the global registry but rejects all incoming JSON-RPC requests (except `ping`) with a `SERVER_PAUSED` error (code `-32005`). This lets an admin interface or AI service temporarily halt a server without destroying its configuration, tools, resources, or prompts. Resume restores normal request handling instantly.
  - `pause()` — pause the server; fires `onMCPServerPause` interception point.
  - `resume()` — resume the server; fires `onMCPServerResume` interception point.
  - `isPaused()` — returns `true` if currently paused.
  - `getSummary()` now includes a `paused` boolean field.
  - New `SERVER_PAUSED: -32005` error code added to `RPC_ERROR_CODES`.
  - Two new interception points registered: `onMCPServerPause`, `onMCPServerResume`.

### 🧠 Improvements

- BoxLang 1.13.0 testing.
- You can now get the binded system message from an agent via `agent.buildSystemMessage()` for debugging and inspection.
- An agent config now includes the `systemMessage` property
- **Type-aware tool schemas**: `ClosureTool.getArgumentsSchema()` now maps BoxLang parameter types to their correct JSON Schema types instead of hard-coding everything as `"string"`. `numeric`/`integer`/`float`/`double` → `"number"`, `boolean` → `"boolean"`, `array` → `"array"` (with `"items": {}`), `struct` → `"object"`. Untyped params default to `"string"`. This means the AI receives accurate type hints and sends native JSON types (booleans, numbers, arrays, objects) instead of string-encoded values.

### 🪲 Fixed

- `ClosureTool.doInvoke()`: MCP clients that send JSON fields as real objects/arrays (instead of pre-stringified JSON) caused a "Can't cast Struct to a string" error before the callable ran. The fix walks the callable's declared parameters and `jsonSerialize()`s any non-simple value whose declared type is `string`, keeping the schema contract intact while accepting both wire formats. Callables that declare `struct`, `array`, or `any` parameters are left untouched.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-04-16

### 🥊 New Features

- **Audio Support — Text-to-Speech, Transcription, and Translation**:
  - **`aiSpeak( text, params, options )`** BIF: Convert text to speech using any provider that supports TTS. Returns an `AiSpeechResponse` (with `hasAudio()`, `saveToFile()`, `getBase64()`, `getMimeType()`, `getSize()`) or saves directly to a file via `options.outputFile`.
  - **`aiTranscribe( audio, params, options )`** BIF: Transcribe audio (file path, URL, or binary) to text. Returns the transcript string by default or a full `AiTranscriptionResponse` when `options.returnFormat = "response"`.
  - **`aiTranslate( audio, params, options )`** BIF: Translate non-English audio to English text using supported providers.
  - **`IAiSpeechService`** interface: Implemented by providers that support TTS (`speak()`).
  - **`IAiTranscriptionService`** interface: Implemented by providers that support STT (`transcribe()` + `translate()`).
  - **Provider support**: OpenAI (TTS + STT), Mistral/Voxtral (TTS + STT), Groq/Whisper (STT + translation), xAI/Grok (TTS), Gemini (TTS + STT), ElevenLabs (TTS + STT — new dedicated audio provider).
  - **`ElevenLabsService`**: New provider supporting high-quality TTS via `eleven_multilingual_v2` and STT via `scribe_v1`. Use `aiService("elevenlabs", apiKey)`.
  - **6 new interception points**: `beforeAISpeech`, `afterAISpeech`, `beforeAITranscription`, `afterAITranscription`, `beforeAITranslation`, `afterAITranslation`.
  - **`audio` settings block** in module config: `defaultVoice`, `defaultOutputFormat`, `defaultSpeechModel`, `defaultTranscriptionModel`.

- **Audio Agent Tools — `speak@bxai`, `transcribe@bxai`, `translate@bxai`**: New `AudioTools` class (`models/tools/audio/AudioTools.bx`) auto-registered in the global tool registry at module startup. `speak@bxai` converts text to speech and returns the saved file path (auto-generates a temp file when no `outputFile` is supplied). `transcribe@bxai` transcribes a local file or URL to plain text. `translate@bxai` translates any-language audio to English text. Opt-in by name: `aiAgent( tools: [ "speak@bxai", "transcribe@bxai", "translate@bxai" ] )`.

- **FileSystem Agent Tools** — New `FileSystemTools` class (`models/tools/filesystem/FileSystemTools.bx`) with 19 `@AITool`-annotated methods covering the full filesystem lifecycle. **NOT auto-registered** — opt-in only via `aiToolRegistry().scanClass()` so agents never get filesystem access unless explicitly granted. Supports a path-guard constructor (`allowedPaths: [...]`) that canonicalizes and validates every path argument before execution, blocking directory-traversal attacks. Tool keys: `readFile@bxai`, `readMultipleFiles@bxai`, `writeFile@bxai`, `appendFile@bxai`, `editFile@bxai`, `fileMetadata@bxai`, `pathExists@bxai`, `deleteFile@bxai`, `moveFile@bxai`, `copyFile@bxai`, `searchFiles@bxai`, `listAllowedDirectories@bxai`, `listDirectory@bxai`, `directoryTree@bxai`, `createDirectory@bxai`, `deleteDirectory@bxai`, `zipFiles@bxai`, `unzipFile@bxai`, `checkZipFile@bxai`.

- **Async Runnables and Parallel Execution**:
  - **`runAsync()` on all runnables** (`IAiRunnable`, `AiBaseRunnable`): Every runnable now has a non-blocking `runAsync(input, params, options)` method that dispatches execution to the `io-tasks` virtual thread pool and returns a `BoxFuture`. Mirrors the existing `aiChatAsync`, `loadAsync()`, and `seedAsync()` patterns throughout the module.
  - **`AiRunnableParallel` class** (`models/runnables/AiRunnableParallel.bx`): New runnable that accepts a named struct of runnables, fans them out concurrently via `runAsync()`, and returns a `{ name: result }` struct once all futures complete. Mirrors LangChain's `RunnableParallel` — a structural parallel composition primitive that integrates cleanly into the existing pipeline system via `.to()`, `.run()`, and `.runAsync()`.
  - **`aiParallel()` BIF**: Creates an `AiRunnableParallel` from a named struct of runnables. `aiParallel({ summary: summaryAgent, analysis: analysisAgent }).run("document")` runs both concurrently and returns `{ summary: "...", analysis: "..." }`.

### 🪲 Fixed

- `chatStream()` across all providers never fires the onAITokenCount event, making streaming calls completely invisible to usage tracking, billing, and monitoring. The non-streaming chat() path fires it correctly.
- `AiModel.stream()`: inject agent and model middleware into `chatRequest`, matching the existing pattern in `run()`
- `DockerModelRunnerService`: capture arguments into local vars before `retryOnModelLoading` closure to prevent `ArgumentsScope` resolution failure
- `OpenAIService.chat()`: capture `chatRequest` before nested `.each()` closures for tool calling
- `OpenAIService.chatStream()`: scope callback and `chatRequest` for `sendStreamRequest` call and tool-calling `.each()` closure
- `CohereService.chat()`: capture `chatRequest` before `.map()` tool closure
- `ClaudeService`, `GeminiService`, `CohereService`, and `BedrockService` `chat()` methods called `sendChatRequest()` / `sendBedrockRequest()` directly, silently bypassing the entire `wrapLLMCall` middleware chain. `beforeLLMCall`, `wrapLLMCall`, and `afterLLMCall` hooks (including `FlightRecorderMiddleware`, retry wrappers, and any custom LLM wrappers) never fired for these providers.
- Standardized the data for the `onAITokenCount` event and add missing event on the following services: `BedrockService, ClaudeService, CohereService, GeminiService`
- MCPServer `scan()` and `scanClass()` where not working accordingly with all cases and permutations.
- Invalid location of directory for flight recorder tapes
- `aiAgent()` bif, `skills, availableSkills` can now be an array or a single skill, we will normalize it to an array internally. This allows for more flexible agent construction with a single skill without needing to wrap it in an array.
- `ModuleConfig.bx` listens now to `onRuntimeStart()` in order to setup skills and more, so caches and other things are properly loaded before the modules.
- Docker Service issues with interface upgrades from previous version.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-04-02

## [2.4.0] - 2026-02-20

## [2.3.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- **Pipeline `_input` System Variable**: Auto-inject previous stage output into message templates via `${_input}`. For struct outputs, individual fields are flattened as `${_input_fieldName}` for template access. Enables clean, composable multi-stage AI pipelines without manual transformation steps.
- `aiTransform()` needd to process instances of `AiTransformRunnable` and `BaseTransformer` classes, allowing for more flexible and reusable transformation logic.
- Stricter and more defensive code when doing tool calling, to prevent errors when tools are called with invalid arguments or when the tool execution fails.

### Fixed

- Tool calling with streaming was not working because the tools were being executed in a different context that didn't have access to the request. Now the request is properly passed to the tool execution context, allowing tools to be called and executed correctly during streaming.
- Agent stream() was not passing tools the correct request, now it does.
- scoping issue on Agent streaming
- fixed BaseMemory getRecent() where limit was not being used
- SummaryMemory was not trimming messages when the summary threshold  was exceeded, and it was recursing forever on summary. Now it properly trims messages until it gets under the threshold, then summarizes and adds the summary message back in.
- BaseTransformer was missing it's internal constructor
- Default for `config` on all `BaseTransformer` classes was missing.
- Fixed a bug where if the `aiTransform()` BIF was called with a non-string or closure, the `throw()` was invalid.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- **AI Skills system** (`aiSkill()` BIF + `withSkills()` / `withAvailableSkills()` APIs on `AiModel` and `AiAgent`): Composable, reusable knowledge blocks — following the [Claude Agent Skills open standard](https://www.anthropic.com/news/agent-skills) — that can be injected into any model or agent system message at runtime.
  - **`aiSkill( path | name, description, content, recurse )`** — Creates or discovers `AiSkill` instances. Pass a file path to load a single `SKILL.md`, a directory path to auto-discover all skills recursively, or `name`/`description`/`content` for inline definitions with no files needed.
  - **`aiGlobalSkills()`** — Returns the globally shared pool of skills auto-injected into every new agent's `availableSkills` pool. Populated via `ModuleConfig.bx` → `settings.globalSkills`.
  - **Always-on skills** (`withSkills()` / `addSkill()`): Full skill content is injected into the system message on every call. Best for small, universally relevant guidance.
  - **Lazy skills** (`withAvailableSkills()` / `addAvailableSkill()`): Only a compact index (name + description) is included in the system message. The LLM calls the auto-registered `loadSkill( name )` tool to fetch full content on demand. Best for large or rarely needed skill libraries.
  - **`activateSkill( name )`** — Moves a skill from the lazy pool to always-on, promoting it for the rest of the session.
  - **`buildSkillsContent()`** — Renders the combined skills system-message block for inspection or custom injection.
  - **SKILL.md format**: Each skill lives in its own subdirectory under `.ai/skills/`. The file is Markdown with an optional YAML frontmatter block containing `description`. The body is the instruction content. If frontmatter is absent, the first paragraph of body text is used as the description.
  - **`AiModel` and `AiAgent` `getConfig()`** now include `activeSkillCount`, `availableSkillCount`, and `skills` (a struct with `activeSkills` and `availableSkills` name/description arrays) for full introspection.
  - **`aiAgent()` BIF** gains `skills: []` and `availableSkills: []` construction-time parameters. Global skills from `aiGlobalSkills()` are automatically prepended to every new agent's available pool.
  - **`aiModel()` BIF** gains a `skills: []` construction-time parameter.
- **MCP server seeding for agents and models**: Agents and models can now be seeded directly with one or more MCP servers. All tools exposed by those servers are automatically discovered via `listTools()` and registered as `MCPTool` instances — no manual Tool construction required.
  - New `MCPTool` class (`models/tools/MCPTool.bx`) implements `ITool` by proxying a single MCP server tool. It converts the MCP `inputSchema` to the OpenAI function-calling schema format and forwards invocations to the server via `MCPClient.send()`.
  - New `withMCPServer( server, config )` fluent method on `AiAgent` and `AiModel`. Accepts a URL string or a pre-configured `MCPClient` instance. Optional `config` struct supports `token`, `timeout`, `headers`, `user`, and `password`.
  - New `withMCPServers( servers )` fluent method on `AiAgent` and `AiModel` for seeding from multiple servers in one call. Each entry can be a URL string, a config struct `{ url, token, timeout, … }`, or a pre-configured `MCPClient`.
  - New `listMcpServers()` method on `AiAgent` and `AiModel` returns the list of currently connected MCP servers with their exposed tools for introspection and debugging.
  - `aiAgent()` and `aiModel()` BIFs gain an `array mcpServers = []` parameter so servers can be provided at construction time.
  - `AiAgent` now tracks connected MCP servers in a `mcpServers` property (`[{ url, toolNames }]`). This list is automatically injected into the system prompt so the LLM can correctly answer questions like _"what MCP servers are you connected to?"_ and _"which tools came from which server?"_
  - New `listTools()` method on `AiAgent` returns `[{ name, description }]` for all registered tools — useful for programmatic introspection.
  - `AiAgent|AiModel.getConfig()` now includes `tools` (full name/description list) and `mcpServers` (server URL + tool-name list) alongside the existing `toolCount`.
- **Global AI Tool Registry**: New singleton `AIToolRegistry` (accessible via `aiToolRegistry()` BIF) provides a module-scoped registry for AI tools. Tools can be registered by name with optional module namespacing (e.g. `now@bxai`), discovered at runtime by bare name or full key, and resolved lazily before LLM requests via `aiToolRegistry().resolveTools()`. This means tools can be referenced by string name in `params.tools` arrays and resolved automatically rather than requiring live object references.
- **`BaseTool` abstract base class**: All tool implementations now extend `BaseTool`, which provides the shared invocation lifecycle (firing `beforeAIToolExecute` and `afterAIToolExecute` interception events), result serialization (primitives pass through, complex values serialize to JSON), and the fluent `describeArg()` / `describe[ArgName]()` schema annotation syntax.
- **`ClosureTool` class**: Replaces the retired `Tool.bx`. A `BaseTool` subclass backed by any closure or lambda. Auto-introspects the callable's parameter metadata to generate an OpenAI-compatible function schema. Receives the originating `AiChatRequest` as `_chatRequest` for context-aware closures.
- **`CoreTools` built-in tools**: Ships two tools out of the box. `now` (registered automatically as `now@bxai` on module load) returns the current date/time in ISO 8601 — ideal for giving the AI temporal awareness. `httpGet` (opt-in only, **not** auto-registered for security) fetches any URL via HTTP GET. Register it explicitly if your application requires web access.
- **Lazy tool resolution**: `params.tools` arrays in `aiChat()`, `aiModel().run()`, and `aiAgent().run()` now accept string registry keys alongside live `ITool` instances. `AIToolRegistry::resolveTools()` converts any string keys to their registered `ITool` before the request is sent.
- Two new interception points: `onAIToolRegistryRegister` and `onAIToolRegistryUnregister`.
- Structured output for ollama tools, allowing for more complex and rich tool responses that can include multiple fields and nested data instead of just a single string output.
- Streaming tools for ollama, allowing tools to return data in a streaming fashion for real-time processing and response generation.
- Tools can now have non-required arguments in their schema
- Tools can now access the full `AiChatRequest` object during invocation, allowing for more complex and context-aware tool behavior. They receive a `_chatRequest` argument that includes all the properties of the original request, such as `messages`, `params`, `options`, and more. This enables tools to make informed decisions based on the full conversation context and request configuration.
- HuggingFace embeddings support
- Ability to send a custom URL to the different senders in the base service.
- Middleware support for `AiModel` and `AiAgent`, with agent middleware prepended ahead of model middleware.
- Provider lifecycle hooks in `preRequest()`, `postResponse()`,for any custom logic before and after requests to change the shape of the request or response, log additional data, etc.  These hooks are provider-specific and allow for custom behavior without needing to override the entire `sendChatRequest()` method.
- **Per-call identity routing on all memory types**: `add()`, `getAll()`, `clear()`, `trim()`, `seed()`, and related methods on every `IAiMemory` and `IVectorMemory` implementation now accept optional `userId` and `conversationId` arguments. This follows the Spring AI `ChatMemory` pattern — a single memory instance can safely serve multiple tenants without creating a new instance per user. Construction-time values remain as fallbacks.
- **Provider capability interfaces**: New `models/providers/capabilities/` package introduces `IAiChatService` and `IAiEmbeddingsService` — scoped interfaces that let providers declare exactly which operations they support at the type level rather than through runtime throws.
- **`getCapabilities()` / `hasCapability()` on all providers**: Every provider now exposes `getCapabilities()` (returns `["chat", "stream", "embeddings", ...]`) and `hasCapability( "chat" )` for clean, self-documenting runtime introspection. These are backed by `isInstanceOf()` checks and stay automatically in sync with the `implements` declarations on each provider — no maintenance required.
- **`AiAgent` parent-child hierarchy**: `AiAgent` now tracks its position in a multi-agent tree through a `parentAgent` property and a full set of hierarchy helpers:
  - `setParentAgent(parent)` — assign a parent with self-reference and cycle-detection guards
  - `clearParentAgent()` — detach from a parent
  - `hasParentAgent()` — returns `true` if the agent has a parent
  - `isRootAgent()` — returns `true` for top-level agents
  - `getRootAgent()` — walks up the tree and returns the root agent
  - `getAgentDepth()` — returns the nesting depth (0 = root, 1 = direct child, …)
  - `getAgentPath()` — returns a slash-delimited path string, e.g. `/coordinator/researcher`
  - `getAncestors()` — returns an ordered array `[immediateParent, …, root]`
  - `addSubAgent()` now automatically calls `setParentAgent(this)` on the sub-agent
  - `setSubAgents()` now calls `clearParentAgent()` on replaced sub-agents before replacing them
  - `getConfig()` now includes `parentAgent` (name string), `agentDepth`, and `agentPath`

### Changed

- Refactored all runnable objects to the `runnables` folder. This includes `AiModel`, `AiAgent`, and `AiMessage`. This better reflects their purpose as executable entities that can be run with different inputs, and allows for a cleaner separation between the core service logic and the runnable wrappers.
- Refactored the `BaseService` to be truly a base and move all OpenAI specific logic to `OpenAIService`, which now serves as the default provider implementation. This allows for cleaner implementations of other providers that don't need to override every method.
- **`AiAgent` is now fully stateless**: `userId`, and `conversationId` are resolved per-call from the `options` argument passed to `run()` and `stream()`, eliminating shared-state concurrency bugs in multi-user deployments.  Seeding a memory with `userId` and `conversationId` is still supported, but these values will be overridden by any values passed in at call time.
- `resume()` and `resumeStream()` now require `threadId` as an explicit `required string` argument instead of defaulting to the former instance property.
- **`IAiService` contract trimmed**: The base interface now declares only identity/configuration/capability-discovery methods (`getName()`, `configure()`, `getCapabilities()`, `hasCapability()`). The operation methods (`invoke()`, `invokeStream()`, `embeddings()`) have moved to their respective capability interfaces where they belong.
- **`VoyageService` now extends `BaseService` directly** and implements only `IAiEmbeddingsService` — it no longer extends `OpenAIService` with stubbed-out chat methods that threw at runtime. The type system now enforces the embeddings-only constraint at compile time.
- **`aiChat()`, `aiChatStream()`, and `aiEmbed()` BIF guards**: Each BIF now checks the provider implements the required capability interface before attempting the call and throws a clear `UnsupportedCapability` exception instead of a cryptic provider error. Zero breaking changes to public BIF signatures.

### Improvements

- Renamed `BaseService.sendRequest()` to `sendChatRequest()`.
- Reduced duplicate payload fields in `onAITokenCount`.

### Fixed

- Model and Agent streaming was not announcing global pre/post events
- Changelog corruption due to merge conflict.
- MCP requestId null scope crash on JSON-RPC notifications for MCP servers
- MiniMax chat errors (`base_resp.status_code != 0`) now surface correctly.
- **`OllamaService` stale `postEmbeddingResponse()` hook**: The old hook was never wired to the current `BaseService` lifecycle and silently did nothing. Replaced with the proper `postResponse( aiRequest, dataPacket, result, operation )` override that guards on `operation != "embeddings"`, identical to how every other dual-capability provider handles this.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **MiniMax AI Provider**: Added support for [MiniMax](https://platform.minimax.io/) AI service with chat, streaming, and embeddings support. Use the `minimax` provider name and set your API key via the `MINIMAX_API_KEY` environment variable.
- Updated `getConfig()` to not show sensitive info.

### Fixed

- BoxLang static constructs instead of inline to avoid issues with never versions.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- **Pipeline `_input` System Variable**: Auto-inject previous stage output into message templates via `${_input}`. For struct outputs, individual fields are flattened as `${_input_fieldName}` for template access. Enables clean, composable multi-stage AI pipelines without manual transformation steps.
- `aiTransform()` needd to process instances of `AiTransformRunnable` and `BaseTransformer` classes, allowing for more flexible and reusable transformation logic.
- Stricter and more defensive code when doing tool calling, to prevent errors when tools are called with invalid arguments or when the tool execution fails.

### Fixed

- Tool calling with streaming was not working because the tools were being executed in a different context that didn't have access to the request. Now the request is properly passed to the tool execution context, allowing tools to be called and executed correctly during streaming.
- Agent stream() was not passing tools the correct request, now it does.
- scoping issue on Agent streaming
- fixed BaseMemory getRecent() where limit was not being used
- SummaryMemory was not trimming messages when the summary threshold  was exceeded, and it was recursing forever on summary. Now it properly trims messages until it gets under the threshold, then summarizes and adds the summary message back in.
- BaseTransformer was missing it's internal constructor
- Default for `config` on all `BaseTransformer` classes was missing.
- Fixed a bug where if the `aiTransform()` BIF was called with a non-string or closure, the `throw()` was invalid.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- Consolidated AI request/response logging with execution time metrics for better performance insights.
- Improved AI request/response to include other metrics in order to provide better insights into performance and potential bottlenecks.

### Improved

- Consolidation of options and settings, to have a single source of truth for configuration and to allow for better overrides and defaults.
- Stream request logging to include execution time metrics for better performance monitoring and debugging insights.
- If the chunk is empty, skip it (keep-alive or heartbeat) when doing chat streams. This prevents unnecessary processing of empty chunks and potential errors when parsing.

### Fixed

- Invalid use of `request` in the `aiChatStream()` BIF, which should have been `chatRequest`.
- Extends for AiTransformRunnable was wrong.
- AiModel extractMessages() was not flattening the messages correctly when the response had multiple choices with multiple messages. Now it properly flattens all messages from all choices into a single array.
- Order of settings merging in `aiChat()` and `aiChatStream()` BIFs was incorrect, causing default options to override user-provided options. Now it merges in the correct order: user options → module settings → default options, allowing for proper overrides.
- Error invoking population in schema builder, the third argument needs to be an array or struct, not a single value.
- Fixed a bug where provider options in the configuration file were not being merged into the request options when creating a service instance.
- Fixed a bug where the `aiService()` BIF was not correctly applying convention-based API key detection when `options.apiKey` was already set but empty. Now it checks if `options.apiKey` is empty before applying the convention key, allowing for proper fallback to environment variables or module settings.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-02-04

What's New: <https://ai.ortusbooks.com/readme/release-history/2.1.0>

### Added

- New event: `onMissingAiProvider` to handle cases where a requested provider is not found.
- `aiModel()` BIF now accepts an additional `options` struct to seed services.
- New configuration: `providers` so you can predefine multiple providers in the module config, with default `params` and `options`.

```js
"providers" : {
	"openai" : {
		"params" : {
			"model" : "gpt-4"
		},
		"options" : {
			"apiKey" : "my-openai-api-key"

		},
		"options" : {
			"baseUrl" : "http://my-ollama-server:11434/"
		}
	}
}
```

- OllamaService now supports custom base URLs for both chat and embeddings endpoints via the `options.baseUrl` parameter.
- `AiBaseRequest.mergeServiceParams()` and `AiBaseRequest.mergeServiceHeaders()` methods now accept an `override` boolean argument to control whether existing values should be overwritten when merging.
- Local Ollama docker setup instructions updated to include the `nomic-embed-text` model for embeddings support.
- Ollama Service now supports embedding generation using the `nomic-embed-text` model.

  - New `getProviderOption(key, defaultValue)` method on requests for retrieving provider options
  - Enables extensibility for any provider-specific features without polluting the common interface
- **OpenSearch Vector Memory Provider**: Full integration with OpenSearch k-NN for semantic search
  - Support for OpenSearch 2.x and 3.x with automatic version detection and space type mapping
  - HNSW index configuration options (M, ef_construction, ef_search parameters)
  - Space type options: cosinesimilarity, l2, innerproduct
  - Basic authentication support (username/password)
  - AWS region configuration for SigV4 authentication with AWS OpenSearch Service
  - Multi-tenant isolation with userId and conversationId filtering
  - Comprehensive test coverage for configuration, validation, and operations
- **OpenAI-Compatible Embedding Support**: Vector memory providers now support custom embedding endpoints
  - New `embeddingOptions` configuration in `BaseVectorMemory` for passing options to embedding provider
  - Use `embeddingOptions.baseURL` for custom OpenAI-compatible embedding service URLs
  - Allows using self-hosted or alternative OpenAI-compatible embedding services
  - Works with providers like Ollama, LM Studio, and other compatible APIs
- **AWS Bedrock Streaming Support**: Full streaming support for Bedrock provider
  - Streaming via `InvokeModelWithResponseStream` API endpoint
  - Support for all model families: Claude, Titan, Llama, Mistral
  - AWS event-stream format parsing with base64 payload decoding
  - OpenAI-compatible streaming response format for consistent callback handling
  - Added more AiError exception handling for service json errors.

### Changed

- All AI provider services now inherit default chat and embedding parameters from the `IAiService` interface, ensuring consistent behavior across providers.
- `IAiService.configure()` method now accepts a generic `options` argument instead of `apiKey`, to better reflect its purpose and support more configuration options.
- `AiRequest` class renamed to `AiChatRequest` for clarity, and multi-modality support.

### Fixed

- Events for chat requests were incorrectly named in the ModuleConfig.bx file. Corrected to `onAIChatRequest`, `onAIChatRequestCreate`, and `onAIChatResponse`.
- `aiChat, aiChatStream` BIF was not passing headers to the AiChatRequest.
- `aiChat, aiChatStream, aiChatAsync` BIF was not using `aiChatRequest()` to build the request, but was building it manually.
- According to the MCP spec prompts should return a key named "arguments" not "args".
- AiRequest was not setting the model correctly from params.
- API key was not being passed to the service in `aiChat(), aiChatStream()` BIF.
- Typo of `chr()` --> `char()` in SSE formatting in MCPRequestProcessor and HTTPTransport.
- `AiModel.getModel()` was not returning the model name correctly when using predefined providers from config.
- Increased Docker Model Runner retry time to 5 seconds with 10 max retries to accommodate large model loading times
- Fixed `url` parameter conflict in OpenSearchVectorMemory by using `requestUrl` for HTTP requests
